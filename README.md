ElvUI Auto Updater

This app uses electron to update ElvUI for World of Warcraft because it's not tracked by Twitch's Addon Manager.

Usage:

Use browse to select the addon folder in your retail/interface/ folder

Hit update

Your ElvUI will be updated

You need to run this program and hit update everytime that ElvUI displays the in-game message 'ElvUI is out-of-date'.
